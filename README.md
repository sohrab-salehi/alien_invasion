# Alien Invasion

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player’s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisities

Since this game is created using Pygame modules. You will need to install Pygame and its dependencies.

**On Linux:**
Install the dependencies first using the packet manager.
```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-dev mercurial
$ sudo apt-get install libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev
```
If you want to add sounds to the game, install the following libraries as well:
```
$ sudo apt-get install libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libportmidi-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libswscale-dev libsmpeg-dev libavformat-dev libavcode-dev
$ sudo apt-get install python-numpy
```
Then finally install Pygame using pip:
```
$ pip install --user hg+http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame
```

**On OSX:**
Install the dependencies using [Homebrew](brew.sh).
```
$ brew install hg sdl sdl_image sdl_ttf
```
*see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for OSX's SDL bug*

And for sound libraries:
```
$ brew install sdl_mixer portmidi
```

Ending by installing Pygame using pip:
```
$ pip3 install --user hg+http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame
```

**On Windows**

Find a [windows installer](https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/downloads/) that matches your version of Python.
Run the installer if it is an exe and if there is an .whl file copy it to the project directory.
Open a command window and navigate to the folder your copied your installer and install using pip.
```
> python -m pip install --user pygame-1.9.2a0-cp35-none-win32.whl
```
